# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congrssional election

 1) Calculate the total number of votes cast
 2) Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
 3) Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
 4) Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
 5) Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.
- The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who had 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Overview
The challenge used Python and Visual Studio Code to determine the winner of a Colorado election.  We were able to detmine the total votes, the number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of votes each candidate received and the winner of the election.

## Election-Audit Summary
This code can be used for any election because it utilizes loops.  By looping through data we do not need to create new code.  The only modification that I think needs to be made is the variables.  Making sure that the variables align with either the candidate or the county is important so that they do not get messed up. Everything else in the code should be working smoothly.  Obviously changing the path names will need to be modified based on the file you are pulling the data from.  This is easy to do because we created a variable that houses the file path.  By doing that, we only need to edit the file path one time.
